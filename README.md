# neural-assertion

This is a cTAKES/UIMA package for doing entity assertion status classification, including code for training, testing, and evaluation. It is built on top of the cleartk-ml-script-keras package for interfacing UIMA code with Keras scripts. The purposes of this repository are 1) A demo of how to interface with Keras from cTAKES, and 2) A home for some of my preliminary experiments on multitask learning for assertion status classification.

Part two is mainly for my own use and probably not ready for general consumption. If you have worked with the SHARP, Mipacq, or other similar corpora in Apache cTAKES before you may be able to figure this out, just drop me a line.
